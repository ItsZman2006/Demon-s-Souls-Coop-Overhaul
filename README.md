# Demon-s-Souls-Coop-Overhaul
A very much in progress coop mod for Demon's Souls (PS3)


This mod is NOT ready for prime time! Also you need access to a custom server which can be found here:

In case your curious as to what I have so far. Heres all I have created.
1. Every class starts off with cling ring (This is for quality of life purposes so you dont have to go fetch it every playthrough)
2. Every class starts off with the Blue Eye Stone and White Eye Stone
3. New item! Stone of Eternal Life (Infinite human form. Similar to the Black Ember from my DS3 Mod)

If you have any preexisting characters you need to create a new character so you get the items
